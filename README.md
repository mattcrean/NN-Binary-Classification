# Neural Network from Scratch for Binary Classification in C++

A C++ implementation of a fully connected feed-forward neural network trained with stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation for binary classification on non-linear datasets.

This project was completed as part of a university scientific computing assignment. The emphasis is on implementing the core learning algorithm from first principles and analysing training behaviour and computational cost.

## Highlights
- Implemented forward pass, loss evaluation, and back-propagation for parameter gradients
- Trained using SGD and evaluated performance across different network depths/widths
- Compared training approaches and discussed computational complexity (see report)

## Repository structure
- `src/` — task implementations and experiments
- `include/` — supporting headers used by the implementation
- `docs/` — project specification and write-up/report
